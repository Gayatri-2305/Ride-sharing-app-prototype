A ride-sharing app prototype is a preliminary version of a mobile or web application that connects passengers with drivers for transportation. It functions as a simplified version of a full-fledged ride-sharing service, allowing users to request rides, receive route information, and potentially track their journey in real-time. An arrangement or instance involving the sharing of rides in a motor vehicle with other people, especially commuters. Also called real-time ridesharing. A car service that allows a person to use a smartphone app to arrange a ride in a usually privately owned vehicle. A ride-sharing app finds the closest available car and matches it with a passenger. Passengers know instantly when a vehicle will arrive and, based on this information, can accept or decline the ride with a driver.
